\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a functional description of \textit{SafeStreets} application.

\subsection{Scope}
\textit{SafeStreets} is a service that aims to provide \textit{Users} with the possibility to notify \textit{Authorities} when traffic 
violations occur, and in particular parking violations. The application's goal is achieved by allowing \textit{Users} 
to share photo, position, date, time and type of violation and by enabling \textit{Authorities} to request them.
\\
\\
\textit{SafeStreets} requires the \textit{Users} to create an account to access its services, the functionalities unlocked after 
registration depend on the type of account created.
\\
If a \textit{User} creates an account as \textit{Citizen}, he/she must provide name, surname and a fiscal code in order to prove 
that he/she is a real person. Furthermore, he must provide an email with which he will be uniquely identified 
and a password. Once the account has been activated, \textit{User} can finally start to report parking violations and can also see 
statistics of the streets or the areas with the highest frequency of violations.
\\
\\
On the other hand, an officer will create an account as \textit{Authority} and he will need to provide his name, surname, 
work's Matricola, a password and as for \textit{Citizen}, will be uniquely identified by an email. Once the Matricola 
has been verified and the account has been activated, the officer can retrieve the potential parking violations 
sent by \textit{Citizen} that have not been taken into account yet by other officers, analyze them and, if it is the 
right case, generates traffic tickets. \textit{Authorities}, can see the same statistics of the \textit{Citizen} and can also see
statistics about vehicles' license plate that commit the most violations.

\subsection{Overview: High level components and their interaction}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/overview.png}
    \caption{\textit{System's} Overview}
\end{figure}

In this graphical representation of \textit{SafeStreets} we describe at an high level the main interaction
between the components that are involved. Focusing on client side \textit{SafeStreets} provides a Client 
application, in this view case we don't make a distinciton between the \textit{Users} type, this is 
primarily devoted to the fact that the requests are similar. We identify then a 3-tier architecture, 
composed by the client, a proxy in the middle to manage properly all the requests and finally a back 
end part in which the \textit{System} store the information (in a DBMS) and generate statistics thanks
to the data submitted by the \textit{Citizen} and confirmed by \textit{Authorities}. In order to do this
we need an application server. Since we will authenticate the \textit{Users} through a confirmation email, 
and we give the possibility to the \textit{Authority} to receive data via mail, the \textit{System} needs
also a Mailing System. For notify the \textit{Users} with some relevant informations \textit{System} will 
use a notification System. Finally we also need some service in the client like GPS Service, Maps Service,
SMTP Service and License Plate Recognition Service. These services are essential to create a proper violation
and to send it correctly.

\subsection{Component view}

\paragraph{Component High Level View}
The following 3 images showing at an high level how the \textit{System} is organized, as we can see the
choice we made is simple, it's a basic client-server architecture. The client presents various components 
each one covers a different role: the Presentation Manager is the medium between the application and the
\textit{User}, Logic Manager is the component designed to catch all the application Logic, it orchestrate
the send report action for \textit{Citizens} and the retrieve report action for \textit{Authorities}, 
Logic Manager is also connected to a cache storage in order to save momentaneously some data. The
Security Manager is crucial for the application, is the component used to ensure the message security 
during the trasmission to server, his main job is to apply a digital firm. The Network Manager handle the
connection and is the component that communicates with server.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Component High Level View}
Here we go deeper in the Component Diagram, are decribed all the interactions between the component
described above and all the external services like the Maps service, license plate Recognition Service and 
STNP service for the client and Mailing System with Push notification System for the server.s 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth, left]{img/component_diagrams/component_diagram_complete.png}
    \caption{Component Diagram Detailed view}
\end{figure}

The purpose of this UML diagram is to show the internal architecture of the System's software. It's divided in 
three component: \textit{SafeStreets} Client Application, SafeStreets Business Logic, External interfaces.
Below we will describe each component. 

\textbf{ \textit{SafeStreets} Client Application }
This component is located on the \textit{User's} device. Its modules are the Network Manager, the Presentation 
Component and Security Manager. The role of the first component is 
to dispatch all incoming and outgoing communications with the application server. The Presentation Component, 
instead, corresponds to the “View” in the MVCS Pattern.

\textbf{\textit{SafeStreets} Business Logic} \\
This component describes core logic of \textit{SafeStreets} application. It is a stateless module 
that lies between the Client application and the central Database. Now we will describe each component:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network Manager} \\
    It handles all incoming messages exchanged between Clients and Server. It does two foundamental
    things; it sends all incoming messages from client application to the correct handler in Business
    Logic and on the contrary it collects all the outgoing messages and sends to the corresponding Client
    Application.
    \item \textbf{Authentication Manager} \\
    The Authentication Manager exposes all methods related to the access to the platform. It handles the
    phase of \textit{User} registration and login and in order to do this it has to continuosly interact with 
    the database through the Data Storage Interface. It also checks all the costraints in order to garantee 
    creation of correct account. Furthermore it sends email to all the \textit{Users} that have been registered 
    by accessing the Mailing \textit{System}'s Interface. 
    \item \textbf{Citizen Manager} \\
    The \textit{Citizen} manager handles all functionalities related to a \textit{Citizen} Account. In order to
    do this it has to continuosly interact with database through the Data Storage Interface. It also allows
    \textit{Citizen} to update his setting. 
    \item \textbf{Authority Manager} \\
    The \textit{Authority} manager handles all functionalities related to an \textit{Authority} Account. In order to
    do this it has to continuosly interact with database through the Data Storage Interface. It also allows
    \textit{Authority} to update his setting.
    %%\item \textbf{Data Manager} \\
    %%This component is the main gateway between the Client Applications and the central Database. It handles the import of 
    %%new data associated to a \textit{User}'s account and its retrieval.
    %\item \textbf{Send Report Manager}\\
    %The Send Report Manager handles the creation and the management of a Send Report performed by \textit{Citizen} and
    %directed to \textit{System}. Inserting is possible thanks to Data Storage Manager. Furthermore, in order to avoid 
    %alteration, the Report is encrypted by using Privacy Manager.
    %\item \textbf{Retrieve Report Manager}\\
    %The Retrieve Report Manager handles the management of a Retrieve Report performed by \textit{Authority}. Retrieving 
    %is possible by querying the central Database through the Data Storage Interface.
    \item \textbf{Statistics Manager} \\
    The Statistics Manager handles the management of a Retrieve Statistics performed by \textit{User}. Retrieving 
    is possible by querying the central Database through the Data Storage Interface.     
    \item \textbf{Privacy Manager} \\
    The Privacy Manager exposes methods to encrypt sensitive data. This operation is important in order to avoid data leaks
    and data alteration.
    \item \textbf{DataBase Manager} \\
    The DataBase Manager provides all methods to interact with the central Database such as data retrieval, 
    storage and update.
    
\end{itemize}

\textbf{External interfaces} \\
Some of the described components in our \textit{System} are also dedicated to communicating with external services through 
specific interfaces. It is essential that the communication works properly in order to fulfill application's functionalities.
This external services are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Database \\
    The component devoted to interacting with the central database on cloud is the Data Storage Manager.
    \item GPS \\
    On the Client side of the application, \textit{SafeStreets} access data from the \textit{User}'s device's GPS through
    the Data Manager Interface. GPS information are important because are used in report to locate a position. 
    \item Mailing System \\
    It used by Authentication Manager to inform an \textit{User} that his account has been correctly created. 
    \item Maps Service \\ 
    It's used to show unsafe areas in statistics.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployement view}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/Deployment_component.png}
    \caption{Deployment view}
\end{figure}  
The architecture choosed for \textit{SafeStreets} is a multi-tier architecture. Below all the nodes 
involved will be described.
\\
\\
\textbf{Smarthphone}\\
Represents the \textit{User's} smarthphone in which the client will run. This is the client machine
that will run \textit{SafeStreets} application.
\\
\\
\textbf{Firewall}\\
Necessary to provide protection between local network and world network, so not-allowed third parties will not be 
able to access data. In particular we decided to use two firewalls to create a DMZ. The first firewall must be configured 
to allow traffic destined to the DMZ only. The second firewall only allows traffic to the DMZ from the internal network.
\\
\\
\textbf{Application Server}
Is the central unit of \textit{SafeStreet} all the other components refer to this. It contains all
the logic and provide bidirectional access to Database i.e. manages data acquisition and requests.
%%Since for \textit{SafeStreet} we need to focus on security, is a though decision to have only one main
%%unit.
We decided to fully replicate Application Servers in order to balance the workload 
\\
\\
\textbf{Proxy}
\textit{System} will use a proxy to receive requests. This solution is more scalable for the eventuality
of further improvements and guarantee a better stability of the \textit{System}. Furthermore Proxy acts as
additional shield against security attacks.  
\\
\\
\textbf{Database}\\
A Database is necessary in order to store all the informations about personal data, registration and 
data submitted by \textit{Citizen} and retrieve information in order, for instance, to build statistics.

\clearpage

\subsection{Runtime View}
\textbf{Proxy Runtime View}
The following sequence diagram describes how the Proxy interacts with the Client and the Application 
Server. When an \textit{User} send a request, checks whether such request conforms to its defined schema and, 
in case the \textit{User} has to be logged in, checks if the provided authToken is associated to an actual 
logged in \textit{User}. This last check, in particular, is efficient to be done on the Proxy instead of each 
Application Server, because if a \textit{User} logs in with a particular Server which then crashes, the 
\textit{User} doesn't have to log in again, since the information is stored on the Proxy. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/Proxy_sequence.png}
    \caption{Proxy Runtime View}
\end{figure}  


\textbf{Login Runtime View}
The following diagram describes the sequence of events when a \textit{User} tries to login in 
\textit{SafeStreets} application. The actors involved are the Presentation and the Network Manager on the
client and the Network Manager, Authentication Manager and the Database Manager on the Server.
When a \textit{User} wants to login in his account, an HTTP request is sent to the application Server
containing his credentials. Database Manager checks the validity of credentials by quering DB. If the query
success then \textit{User} can correctly be authenticated. The two errors that can occur are HTTP ERROR 400:
Malformed Request and HTTP ERROR 401 Wrong Credentials. The first one occurs when request's format is invalid,
such as having empty parameters. The second one occurs when credentials are wrong.   

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/login_sequence.png}
    \caption{Login Runtime View}
\end{figure}  

\textbf{Registration Runtime View}  the registration sequence shows the step followed for the 
registration of a new \textit{User}. The two registration procedures for \textit{Citizen} and  
\textit{Authority} are similar, the only thing that change is the code used, for the first is 
needed the fiscal code for the second the Matricola number, to avoid a duplicate we show here 
the general procedure. After filling the form data are sended through the proxy at the main server, 
here data will be secured and stored in the database. Here 2 situations may occur, the \textit{User} 
data aren't already present in the database so \textit{User's} data will be stored and \textit{System} 
can continue with the process sending client a success message or data inserted have been already used 
by another \textit{User} and the client will receive an error message. This process will be repeated 
until success message. When \textit{User's} data are correctly stored the \textit{System} will send a 
confirmation email with a token in order to activate the account. Then \textit{System} wait until the 
\textit{User} clicks the confirm link in the mail received, clicking the link will send the token to 
server, again two situation may occur, the token is valid and the procedure terminate with the account 
activation or the token isn't valid and the \textit{User} need to request another confirmation email.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/registration_sequence.png}
    \caption{Registration Runtime View}
\end{figure}  

\textbf{Send Report Runtime View}
The following diagram represents the sequence of actions executed on the \textit{Citizen's} send report, 
first all the necessary data is gathered, the nex sequence will describe in a more detailed way how it's 
done, here is simplified for a better readability. Then data collected is passed at the Logic Manager, 
it will secure the data applying a digital firm through the Security Manager, then the violation is 
saved momentaneously in the cache and sent at the server. As described in the picture, Logic Manager 
save the violation in the cacheto avoid loss, if there is a malicious attack in the way to the server 
in order to modify the violation then the digital firm will be compromised, in this case the server 
will reject the violation and it will be lost, to avoid this inconvenience the client saves the report 
in the cache and will send it at every timetout until it recevies from the server the success message. 
In the other hand the server will save the report and send the success message if only if the digital 
firm is correct. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/send_report_sequence.png}
    \caption{Send Report Runtime View}
\end{figure}  

\textbf{Collect External Data Runtime View}  
This is a "zoom" on the self call "retrieve gps, license, date time" that Presentation does in the 
previuos sequence, it's only a graphical semplification in aim to better understanding the process, 
separating this fase make more readable the previous image. This steps show how information are 
retrieved from external services, those information will be used to create the report by the Logic Manager.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/collect_external_data_sequence.png}
    \caption{Collect External Data Runtime View}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Retrieve Report Runtime View}
The following diagram describes the sequence of events when an \textit{Authority} tries to retrieve a violation in
\textit{SafeStreets} application. The actors involved are the Presentation, Security Manager and the Network 
Manager on the client and the Network Manager, Report Manager and the Database Manager on the Server.
When an \textit{Authority} clicks the retrive button an HTTP request is sent to the Application Server in order to
query the DB and retrive the violation. Once the violation has been retrieved, Securith Manager checks violation's 
validity by computing the hash and matching it with the one from the digitally sign. If the two hash are the same then
Security Manager sends the violation to \textit{Authority}. When \textit{Authority} clicks the "YES" or "NO" button a final
HTTP request is sent to Application Server containing the response. It is important because in this way \textit{System} can
build Statistics. If, instead, the two hash are not the same then a malicious attacker is trying to alterate information so
Security Manager discards the violation and waits for the timeout. In this way Report Manager can sends the violation again.     

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/retrieve_report.png}
    \caption{Retrieve Report Runtime View}
\end{figure}  


\textbf{Retrieve Statistics Runtime View}
The following diagram describes the sequence of events when a \textit{User} tries to retrieve statistics in
\textit{SafeStreets} application. The actors involved are the Presentation, GPS, Google Maps and the Network 
Manager on the client and the Network Manager, Statistics Manager and the Database Manager on the Server.
When a \textit{User} clicks the retrieve button two HTTP requests are sent, one to GPS Service and the other
one to Google Maps Service, in order to know the exact position of the \textit{User} and the area in which he is
using the app. After that an other HTTP request is sent to Application Server in order to retrieve statistics by 
quering DB. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/sequence_diagrams/retrieve_statistics.png}
    \caption{Retrieve Statistics Runtime View}
\end{figure}  

\subsection{Component Interfaces}
\subsection{Selected architectural styles and patterns}

\textbf{REST}
Our \textit{System} uses the Representational state transfer (REST) architectural style in order to achieve 
performance in component interactions, scalability, modifiability of components to meet changing needs, portability 
of components by moving program code with the data and reliability in the resistance to failure at the system level
in the presence of failures within components, connectors, or data. HTTP is the communication protocol used underneath, 
so CRUD operations are implemented through GET, POST, DELETE and PUT primitives.


\textbf{MVC}
Our \textit{System} follows the MVC paradigm. As shown in the picture The acronyms stands for Model View Controller

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/mvc-architecture.png}
    \caption{MVC Architecture}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Model corresponds to the component containing all the application's data and integrity constraints. 
    In our case the Model is described in the external database.
    \item The View corresponds to the presentation layer, the client's only interface with the \textit{System}.
    \item The Controller is responsible for the logic of the application and in our case corresponds to \textit{SafeStreets}
    Business Logic.
\end{itemize}
\clearpage

\subsection{Other design decision}
\textbf{Firewall}
According to Colton Fralick approch, Our \textit{System} use two firewalls to create a DMZ. The first 
firewall must be configured to allow traffic destined to the DMZ only. The second firewall only 
allows traffic to the DMZ from the internal network. This setup is considered more secure since two 
devices would need to be compromised. Network firewalls operate by filtering the packets trying to 
pass through them.

\textbf{DataBase}
It was decided to use a relational database model for \textit{SafeStreets}, as opposed to a 
non-relational model, because it allows to represent the intrinsic relationships present in 
the data needed to be stored. Also, many complex operations will be made on the database, 
including Joins and Updates, which are not well handled by a non-relational model.

\textbf{ER Diagram}
This is an oversimplified representation of the database schemas. This is only a general view 

on the mandatory attributes needed the focus is on the relevant attributes and tables. We omitted 
for simplicity other attribute less important, statistics for example may need some other attributes 
useful to perform searches more efficiently. In the ER schema there are four main entity:  
\textit{Citizen} and \textit{Authority} identified as \textit{Users}, the two entity Vehicle and 
Location separated in two distinct table in order to make the process of statistics generation more 
efficient as possible and the entity Violation that is identified by date, time, location and license 
plate to guarantee unicity. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/ER_diagram.png}
    \caption{ER Diagram}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\section{User Interface Design} 
This is the application main flow either for the Citizen and Authority, they both start with login 
or registration and then they have access to the respective pages. \textit{Citizen} will be able to 
visualize violations statistics, settings and send report page. The \textit{Authority} can access 
same statistics as \textit{Citizen} plus vehicles statistics and the page in which can retrieve report 
information and also a settings page.

\section{Implementation, Integration and Test Plan}
\subsection{Overview}
For what concern the part of implementation we identify 3 macros subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The client subsystem, containing the presentation.
    \item The server subsystem, containing components of Business Logic and the interaction with DB.
    \item External Services, such as DB, Maps Service, STNP Service, License Plate Recognition Service. 
\end{itemize}  
Our implementation and testing will be incremental and will follow the bottom-up approach.

\subsection{Implementation}
The order of implementation we decided to follow is necessary in order to obtain consistency:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item creation of the Database and its costraints.
    \item server and client implementation
    \item integration with external services
\end{enumerate}

The implementation of the server and the client will be in parallel in order to increase the efficiency.
The implementation of the server will follow this order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Database manger
    \item Network manager (to receive request from a fake client)
    \item Authentication manager (to authenticate some test users)
    \item Privacy manager
    \item Settings manager
    \item Report manager
    \item Statistics manager
\end{enumerate}
In particular DataBase Manager and Network Manager will be implemented first because they represents the access 
point to the Clients and the DB \\\\

For what concern the implementation of the client:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User Interface implementation (we will implement the same graphic for both iOs and Android) (view dell'MVC)
    \item Network manager
    \item Presentation manager
    \item Security manager
    \item Logic manager
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Unit testing}
During the whole phase of implementation component's unit tests will be performed in order to find any possible kind of bugs.
Unit tests will be added incrementally as new code is written. In this way is possible to fix bugs with the lowest cost of 
repair in terms of effort and time. Using the bottom-up approach we need to simulate the components that are missing in order
to test the component just added. To do so driver will be used to simulate calls to a certain component. Stubs, instead, will be 
used to simulate external services such as Maps Service or SNTP service.    


\subsection{Integration testing}
\textbf{Integration of internal components of the Application Server}

\textbf{Integration of Client}

\textbf{Integration of Client-Server}

\textbf{Integretion of External Services}
